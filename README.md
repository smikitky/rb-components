# React-Bootstrap Components

Project-agnostic component sets used with react-bootstrap.

Package consumers should directly `require` or `import` components
in the `lib` directory.

```
import IconButton from '@smikitky/rb-components/lib/IconButton';
```

These are written in ES2015 with `object-rest-spread`,
so you'll need to transpile them using Babel or TypeScript set up for your project.

Internal use only.
